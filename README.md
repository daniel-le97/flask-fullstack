# Flask fullstack intro


this is my first time using python
i created this to see if i could learn python easily

it is a very basic app, and does not aim to make the ui pretty

## stack
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- sqlite
- bootstrap
- htmx

make is used as a task runner, check [makefile](./makefile) to see available tasks

0Auth2 authentication is setup and configured out of the box for google and github, too add more providers check [config](./app/config.py)
this may be switched to [authlib](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/index.html) in the future
